## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Learning Material UI**
Challenge: It was my first time working with Material UI (MUI), so getting familiar with the components, design principles, and overall structure was initially challenging. Material UI has a lot of customizable options, and understanding how to integrate them into the React application was not straightforward at first.

Solution: To overcome this, I followed a few YouTube tutorials and referred to the official Material UI documentation to get a better understanding of how to work with the library. Key resources that helped were:

https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/

I also used ChatGPT as a resource while coding to clarify doubts and get suggestions on how to implement certain components or solve specific problems. Once I understood the fundamentals and structure of MUI, I was able to integrate its components effectively and create a clean and intuitive user interface.
